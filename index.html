        <h5>How to File an Election Complaint</h5>
        <p> First, report polling place issues to the Judge of Elections at your polling place before you leave.
            If your issue is not resolved by the Judge of Elections, report the issue to your county election office by completing our online form or by downloading and completing the 
            HAVA complaint form if you believe your voting rights may have been violated.</p>

        <h4>Accessible Voting</h4>
        <h5>Is there an accessible voting system at my polling place?</h5>
        <p> Every polling place in Pennsylvania must have at least one accessible voting system. Sometimes this is the general voting system used by all voters. It may be a separate system with features such as audio, tactile keys, and other assistive technology.
            Look up the accessible voting system in your county
            Find your polling place to see if it is accessible
            Contact your county election office</p>

        <h4>Voting at a Polling Place</h4>
        <h5>Know What to Expect</h5>
        <p> Here is what to expect when you vote in person at your polling place on Election Day.
        Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day. Remember, if you are in line by 8 p.m., you can vote.
        When you arrive, you will check in with the poll workers.
        Then, you will either hand mark a paper ballot or cast your vote using a machine called a ballot marking device. 
        Find a video demo of your county's voting system so you can be prepared.</p>

        <h4>Mail-in and Absentee Ballot</h4>
        <h5>In Pennsylvania, registered voters can request either a no-excuse mail-in ballot or an absentee ballot.</h5>
        <ul>
            <li> Mail-in ballot: Any registered voter may apply to vote by mail in the next election. You do not have to provide a reason for why you want to vote by mail ballot.</li>
            <li>Absentee ballot: If you will be out of your municipality on Election Day or if you have a disability or illness that prevents you from going to your polling place on Election Day, you can request this ballot type, which requires you to provide a reason for why you want to vote by mail ballot.</li>
